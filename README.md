# BeTheHero

Be the hero is a project created to help non-governmental organizations to acquire financing or help during the day-to-day challenges faced by them. Using the Web interface an admin of an NGO could register its organization in the platform and register some incident raise funds. A mobile interface was created to the final users (the funders) to elect an incident that it intends to help.
